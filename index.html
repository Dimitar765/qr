            <p>Established in 2021 from chemical engineer Stanko Ilikj Popov</p>
            <p>
                Main goals when the laboratory was opened were chemical and
                mechanical control of building materials for civil construction,
                innovations in the waste industry management, innovations in
                usage of industrial waste, increasing the environmental
                awareness threw using industrial, communal and civil
                construction waste as raw materials for new products.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2022 the company IMK got the attention of a Switzerland
                potential partner and by the end of year 2022 got foreign
                capital for investing in laboratory instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the same year IMK was supported by start up fond SECO
                (Federal Department of Economic Affairs of Switzerland).

            <h3>
                Environmental study for EuroNickel Industri Kavadarci for using
                generators for electricity production
            </h3>
            <p>
                The study was done for usage of heavy oil as burning fuel for
                electricity production. The problem was the aero pollution and
                the content of sulphur in the heavy oil. The solution that IMK
                presented was SCR catalyst unit decreasing the levels of
                pollutants to permissible limits.

            <h3>Hexavalent chromium neutralization from dump fill Jugohrom</h3>
            <p>
                IMK as company developed chemical method for neutralization of
                hexavalent chromium present in solid and liquid materials with
                using of advanced machinery and techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same approach of work can be used for arsenic, cyanide and
                heavy metal removal.
            </p>
            <p>
                The content of hexavalent chromium in the samples was decreased
                from 2.5 g/l to 0.005 mg/l.

                Thomas phosphate contains approximately 43% CaO and 21% P2O5 .
                The rest is mainly FeO and SiO2

            </p>
            <p>
                Secondary materials are very important part of todays circular
                economy and we are prepared to find a suitable usage for all
                industrial and civil construction waste materials
            </p>
            <p>
                Raw materials from industrial dump fills are an environmental
                problem if not treated and reused for another purpose
            </p>
            <p>
                Civil construction waste materials are also an environmental
                problem if left on municipal dump fills because the time needed
                for their decomposition is very long
            </p>
            <p>
                We will continue our work and our innovation in this field and
